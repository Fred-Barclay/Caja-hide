Name: Caja Hide Extension requires restarting Caja
Priority: High
Terminal: False
DontShowAfterReboot: True
DisplayIf: pgrep caja
Description: Caja Hide Extension has been installed. Restart of Caja is needed to make it work properly (hint: 'caja -q' in terminal). Or if you prefer, a session restart will be more than enough. After restart, a new option will emerge in the Caja context menu. This option lets you hide selected files or folders without renaming them (no extra '.' or '~' added).
